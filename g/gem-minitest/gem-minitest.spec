%description
Minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD,
mocking, and benchmarking. "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week
and we were allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test frameworks... I MUST say
that minitest is *very* readable / understandable compared to the 'other two'
options we looked at. Nicely done and thank you for helping us keep our mental
sanity." -- Wayne E. Seguin minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit
testing framework. It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean
and readable. minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks
onto minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations. minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of
your algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential one!
minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub) object
framework. minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P minitest/test
is meant to have a clean implementation for language implementors that need a
minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working test suite. For example, there is
no magic involved for test-case discovery. "Again, I can't praise enough the
idea of a testing/specing framework that I can actually read in full in one
sitting!" -- Piotr Szotkowski Comparing to rspec: rspec is a testing DSL.
minitest is ruby. -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest" minitest doesn't
reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like: classes, modules,
inheritance, methods. This means you only have to learn ruby to use minitest and
all of your regular OO practices like extract-method refactorings still apply.

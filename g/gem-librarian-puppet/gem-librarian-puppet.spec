%description
Librarian-puppet is a bundler for your puppet infrastructure. You can use
librarian-puppet to manage the puppet modules your infrastructure depends on,
whether the modules come from the Puppet Forge, Git repositories or just a
path.

* Librarian-puppet can reuse the dependencies listed in your Modulefile or
metadata.json
* Forge modules can be installed from Puppetlabs Forge or an internal Forge such
as Pulp
* Git modules can be installed from a branch, tag or specific commit, optionally
using a path inside the repository
* Modules can be installed from GitHub using tarballs, without needing Git
installed
* Modules can be installed from a filesystem path
* Module dependencies are resolved transitively without needing to list all the
modules explicitly

Librarian-puppet manages your modules/ directory for you based on your
Puppetfile. Your Puppetfile becomes the authoritative source for what modules
you require and at what version, tag or branch.

Once using Librarian-puppet you should not modify the contents of your modules
directory. The individual modules' repos should be updated, tagged with a new
release and the version bumped in your Puppetfile.

It is based on Librarian, a framework for writing bundlers, which are tools that
resolve, fetch, install, and isolate a project's dependencies.

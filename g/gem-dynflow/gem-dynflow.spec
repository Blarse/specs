%description
Dynflow [DYN(amic work)FLOW] is a workflow engine written in Ruby that allows
to:
* keep track of the progress of running process
* run the code asynchronously
* resume the process when something goes wrong, skip some steps when needed
* detect independent parts and run them concurrently
* compose simple actions into more complex scenarios
* extend the workflows from third-party libraries
* keep consistency between local transactional database and external services
* suspend the long-running steps, not blocking the thread pool
* cancel steps when possible
* extend the actions behavior with middlewares
* define the input/output interface between the building blocks (planned)
* define rollback for the workflow (planned)
* have multiple workers for distributing the load (planned)

Dynflow doesn't try to choose the best tool for the jobs, as the right tool
depends on the context. Instead, it provides interfaces for persistence,
transaction layer or executor implementation, giving you the last word in
choosing the right one (providing default implementations as well).

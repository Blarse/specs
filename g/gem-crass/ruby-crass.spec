%description
Crass is a Ruby CSS parser that's fully compliant with the CSS Syntax Level 3
specification.

Features:
* Pure Ruby, with no runtime dependencies other than Ruby 1.9.x or higher.
* Tokenizes and parses CSS according to the rules defined in the 14 November
  2014 editor's draft of the CSS Syntax Level 3 specification.
* Extremely tolerant of broken or invalid CSS. If a browser can handle it,
  Crass should be able to handle it too.
* Optionally includes comments in the token stream.
* Optionally preserves certain CSS hacks, such as the IE "*" hack, which would
  otherwise be discarded according to CSS3 tokenizing rules.
* Capable of serializing the parse tree back to CSS while maintaining all
  original whitespace, comments, and indentation.

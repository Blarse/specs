%changelog
* Mon May 22 2023 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.1.4-alt1
- Add checking of user rights to execute methods using polkit.
- Data from alterator-manager is now transferred not in a GHashTable, but in
  a structure ManagerData.

* Fri Apr 21 2023 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.1.3-alt1
- Add limit on the number of threads for the method. How many method instances
  can be run at the same time.

* Tue Apr 04 2023 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.1.2-alt1
- Add the ability to return stdout and stderr through an array of strings or
  an array of bytes (stdout only).
- The signal name is now formed by concatenating the string specified in
  the backend file and the sender. Dots and colons in the sender are replaced
  with underscores. If the signal name in the backend file is not specified,
  then the signals are disabled.
- Add the ability to limit stdout and stderr arrays in bytes (Default 524288).
- Add the ability to disable the return of stdout and stderr arrays using
  special options in the backend file.

* Mon Feb 27 2023 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.1.1-alt1
- Fix child's stderr and stdout pipes not closing.

* Thu Feb 16 2023 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.1.0-alt1
- All backend files are now loaded in the manager, and modules receive a
  pointer to a table with data that contains information about D-Bus objects
  and handlers. One file describes one interface for one module.
- The interaction between the manager and modules has changed: the module now
  returns not xml, but an instance of GDBusInterfaceInfo (it writes a pointer
  to this instance to the table with data received from the manager, a
  pointer to the vtable is also written there).

* Tue Dec 20 2022 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.0.3-alt1
- Add child process's stdout and stderr through signals.

* Sat Oct 22 2022 Evgeny Sinelnikov <sin@altlinux.org> 0.0.2-alt1
- Second work version.

* Wed Oct 12 2022 Ivan Savin <svn17@altlinux.org> 0.0.1-alt1
- First work version.

%changelog
* Tue Jun 06 2023 Gleb F-Malinovskiy <glebfm@altlinux.org> 0.2-alt1
- Modified the stateless pipeline method as follows:
  + Avoid attempting to unmount the host filesystem in overlay mode;
  + Deactivate LUKS-encrypted host devices that are unmounted;
  + Treat comma (,) in the same way as the pipe symbol (|) when processing the
  STATELESS_IMAGES variable;
  + When unpacking subsequent image layers, use the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
  files from preceding image layers.

* Fri Mar 25 2022 Gleb F-Malinovskiy <glebfm@altlinux.org> 0.1-alt1

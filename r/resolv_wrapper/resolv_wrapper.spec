%description
It is likely that if you have a server/client architecture, you need to do DNS
queries or a third party library, like Kerberos needs to be able to do queries.
In the case of Kerberos the client needs to look the address of the KDC up via a
SRV record. resolv_wrapper is able to either redirect all DNS queries to your
DNS server implementation, or fake DNS replies!

To use it set the following environment variables:

LD_PRELOAD=libresolv_wrapper.so
RESOLV_WRAPPER_CONF=./my_resolv.conf

This package doesn't have a devel package because this project is for
development/testing.

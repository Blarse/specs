Name: rpm-build-extra-targets
Version: 0.1
Release: alt1

Summary: Build packages for other platforms
License: GPLv2+
Group: Development/Other

Source: %name-%version-%release.tar

Requires: rpm-build

%description
This package adds a few files required to build RPM packages
for targets that current platform does not support.

This may be useful for OS bootstrap, re-packaging binaries,
checking architecture-specific patches with 'rpmbuild -bp',
or for testing Linux kernels and hardware-specific packages
(like u-boot) in pair with cross-compilation.

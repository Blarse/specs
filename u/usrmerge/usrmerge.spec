%description hier-convert
A script which merges /bin, /sbin, /lib, /lib%_lib with their counterparts
under /usr, as safely as possible.

This package contains the script which converts the hierarchy layout.
It is intended to be called from a filetrigger or in rpm pretrans stage, but
can be invoked directly by an administrator who knows what they are doing.

%description block
This metapackage contains nothing. Its purpose is to keep the filesystem
package in a system compatible with unmerged-usr, if this is temporarily
desired on some machine.

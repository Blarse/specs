%description
Wt (pronounced as witty) is a C++ library for developing web applications.

The API is widget-centric and uses well-tested patterns of desktop GUI development 
tailored to the web. 
To the developer, it offers abstraction of many web-specific implementation details, 
including client-server protocols (HTTP, Ajax, WebSockets), 
and frees the developer from tedious JavaScript manipulations of HTML and dealing 
with cross-browser issues. Instead, with Wt, 
you can focus on actual functionality with a rich set of feature-complete widgets.

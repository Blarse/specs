Name: libdeflate
Version: 1.8
Release: alt1
Summary: Heavily optimized library for DEFLATE/zlib/gzip compression and decompression
License: MIT

BuildRequires: zlib-devel

%description
libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression
and decompression.

The supported formats are:

    DEFLATE (raw)
    zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
    gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)

libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib
library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
processors. In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression
modes that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".

%description utils
libdeflate itself is a library, but the following command-line programs
which use this library are also provided:

libdeflate-gzip (or libdeflate-gunzip), a program which mostly behaves
like the standard equivalent, except that it does not yet have good
streaming support and therefore does not yet support very large files

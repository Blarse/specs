%description
%summary.

Note that '%%pretrans' scriptlets MUST be written in Lua and thus use -p <lua>
in order to function during initial system installation when no shell has yet
been installed.

%build
date > file.txt

%install
install -Dpm644 file.txt -t %buildroot%_libexecdir/%name/dir
# Now make 'symlinked' a directory.
install -Dpm644 file.txt -t %buildroot%_libexecdir/%name/symlinked

# "Replacing a symlink to a directory with a regular directory is much simpler,
# since thereâ€™s no potential for accidentally removing files added externally.
# The following scriptlet checks for and removes the symlink. There is no need
# to create the directory here, as RPM will do so later in the transaction when
# the package is installed."
#
%pretrans -p <lua>
-- Define the path to the symlink being replaced below.
path = "%_libexecdir/%name/symlinked"
st = posix.stat(path)
if st and st.type == "link" then
  os.remove(path)
end

%check
cd %buildroot
find .%_libexecdir/%name -ls

%files
%_libexecdir/%name

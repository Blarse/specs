%description
VictoriaMetrics cluster consists of the following services:

- vmstorage - stores the data
- vminsert - proxies the ingested data to vmstorage shards using consistent hashing
- vmselect - performs incoming queries using the data from vmstorage

Each service may scale independently and may run on the most suitable hardware.
vmstorage nodes don't know about each other, don't communicate with each other and don't share any data.
This is shared nothing architecture.
It increases cluster availability, simplifies cluster maintenance and cluster scaling.

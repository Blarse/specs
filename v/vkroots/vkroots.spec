%description
vkroots is incredibly easy to integrate into your project,
it's a single include, and even supports defining multiple
layers in a single shared library with VKROOTS_NEGOTIATION_INTERFACE.

All you do is just implement the functions you want,
and they are automagically hooked using C++20 concepts magic!

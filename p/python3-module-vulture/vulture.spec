%description
Vulture finds unused classes, functions and variables in your code.
This helps you cleanup and find errors in your programs. If you run it
on both your library and test suite you can find untested code.
Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like vulture
are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called
implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, vulture can be a
very helpful tool for higher code quality.

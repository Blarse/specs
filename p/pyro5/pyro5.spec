%description
Pyro means PYthon Remote Objects.

It is a library for building applications in which objects can talk
to each other over the network. One can use normal Python method
calls, with almost every possible parameter and return value type,
and Pyro takes care of locating the right object on the right system
to execute the method. It also provides a set of features that enable
building distributed applications. Pyro is a pure Python library and
runs on many different platforms and Python versions.

%description
asks is an async requests-like HTTP lib, for use in conjunction with the wonderful curio and trio async libs.

asks aims to have a mostly familiar API, using simple functions/methods like get() for getting and post() for posting.
At the heart of asks is a session class which
makes interacting with the web in a sustained and fluid way fast, efficient, and simple.

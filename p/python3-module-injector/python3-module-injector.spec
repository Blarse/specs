%description
While dependency injection is easy to do in Python due to its support for
keyword arguments, the ease with which objects can be mocked and its dynamic
nature, a framework for assisting in this process can remove a lot of
boiler-plate from larger applications. That's where Injector can help. It
automatically and transitively provides dependencies for you. As an added
benefit, Injector encourages nicely compartmentalised code through the use of
:ref:modules <module>.

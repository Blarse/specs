%description
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for
Python. That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in
images.

Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract,
as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica
imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the
recognized text instead of writing it to a file.

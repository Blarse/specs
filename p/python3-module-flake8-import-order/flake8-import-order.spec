%description
A flake8 and Pylama plugin that checks the ordering of your imports.
It does not check anything else about the imports. Merely that they are grouped
and ordered correctly.
In general stdlib comes first, then 3rd party, then local packages, and that
each group is individually alphabetized, however this depends on the style used.
Flake8-Import-Order supports a number of styles and is extensible allowing for
custom styles.
This plugin was originally developed to match the style preferences of the
cryptography project, with this style remaining the default.

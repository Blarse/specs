%description
This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms
as well as implementations of several planarity-related graph algorithms.
The origin of this project is the reference implementation for the Edge
Addition Planarity Algorithm, which is now the fastest and simplest
linear-time method for planar graph embedding and planarity obstruction
isolation (i.e. Kuratowski subgraph isolation).

The software in this code project provides a graph algorithm framework and
library, including an updated version of the edge addition combinatorial
planar graph embedder and planar obstruction isolator (i.e., a Kuratowski
subgraph isolator). This code project also includes several extensions
that implement planarity-related algorithms such as a planar graph drawing
algorithm, an outerplanar graph embedder and outerplanar obstruction
isolator, and a number of subgraph homeomorphism search algorithms.

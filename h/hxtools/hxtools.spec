%description -n ofl
Lists all processes that have directories or files open or in use within path.
Additionally it can send a signal to these processes to free up a mountpoint
for example.

%package -n fd0ssh
Summary: pipe for password-over-stdin support to ssh
Group: Other
License: LGPL-2.1 or LGPL-3.0

%description -n fd0ssh
This is a wrapper for ssh which reads the password from stdin and sets things
up so that ssh will recall the wrapper to get the password, which will be read
from the parent process using a pipe.

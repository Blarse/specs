%description
The SharedMeatAxe is a dynamic (shared) library together with a set of
programs for working with matrices over finite fields.  It is a fork of
the C MeatAxe, and differs from it mainly by the implementation of
asymptotically fast matrix multiplication and by providing a dynamic
(as opposed to static) library and an autotoolized build system.

MeatAxe's primary purpose is the calculation of modular character
tables, although it can be used for other purposes, such as
investigating subgroup structure, module structure etc.  Indeed, there
is a set of programs to compute automatically the submodule lattice of
a given module.

The primitive objects are of two types: matrices and permutations.
Permutation objects can be handled, but not as smoothly as you might
expect.  For example, it is hoped that programs such as split (zsp) and
multiply (zmu) will be able to work with mixed types, but at present
ZSP is restricted to matrices only, and ZMU can multiply a matrix by a
permutation, but not vice versa.

%description -n libmtx%soname
This package contains the SharedMeatAxe library, which provides
functions for working with matrix representations over finite fields.
Permutation representations are supported to some extent, too.
